# Adirontech T.R.E.K. Project

The T.R.E.K., Trail Registration Electronic Kiosk, project consists of a react web-app, a kiosk system, and a postgreSQL database for the two. The web-app allows users to pre-register and plan their intended trips to the Adirondack Mountain trails. Trail managers from the Adirondack Wilderness Advocates organization will be able to use the web-app to view aggregate past and current trail usage information. 

## Web-app

The web-app allows users to pre-register and plan their intended trips to the Adirondack Mountain trails. Hikers will be able to view the trail districts as well as relevant information about the district and trails they plan on visiting.

Trail managers from the Adirondack Wilderness Advocates organization will be able to use the web-app to view aggregate past and current trail usage information. This will allow them to make accurate decisions when delegating resources to protecting the Adirondack Wilderness.


## Kiosk System

The kiosk system will consist of two different main functions. One will be connected to the internet while the other will be completely remote.

Kiosks connected to the internet will be located at the top of the trailheads. Trailhead kiosks will allow users to check in to their pre-registered trips as well as to register on the spot if they had not done so prior. This data will be sent to the database where trial managers can access.

Remote kiosks will be scattered amongst the trails at junctions and popular areas. These will be equipped with Bluetooth pinging that will count passing by foot traffic of hikers whose Bluetooth is turned on. This data will be downloaded manually from trail managers and then uploaded to the database.
